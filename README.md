## About me



Hi there! 👋 

I’m a full stack web developer that has practical experience with the MERN stack. I believe gaining knowledge is essential as a developer since there are always new advancements in the field. Which is why I strive to acquire new skills and to expand my skillset in order to apply them in various fields. 



**The idea of creating websites has been a passion of mine since I was 18.** Ever since I took an HTML class when I was still in cégep in 2016, I discovered that there was a lot more than meets the eye when it comes to creating websites. The complexity and logic behind every element that composes a page and the amount of creativity that it requires has fascinated me ever since then.
